# Bachelor-Thesis
• Main idea of project is to give more reliable and promising cloud storage service. 
• Traditional methods for this usually use low- level data hiding methods like embedding a secret data into the host images, which poses critical issues like data availability, security, privacy and integrity. This project enables new perspective on DNA based cryptography, which ensures secure data storage on multi-cloud. 
• Main features /challenges: DNA Based Cryptography, multi-cloud architecture, redundancy in data distribution, assured data availability. 
• Technology & tools: Java, NetBeans IDE, Dropbox Cloud storage
• Team size: 4; My Role: Develop algorithm and implement DNA based encryption of data utilizing biological characteristics of DNA sequences and contribution to UI development
